# face-Recognition-Attendance-System

As an aspiring developer, I have designed and implemented a face recognition attendance system using Python. This project showcases my skills in computer vision, machine learning, and programming.

The face recognition attendance system works by capturing images of individuals in a given environment and storing them in a database. When the individuals return to the environment, the system uses a facial recognition algorithm to match their faces with the images in the database and records their attendance.

I implemented the project using Python and various open-source libraries, such as OpenCV, face_recognition, and NumPy. I also utilized deep learning techniques, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to enhance the accuracy of the facial recognition algorithm.

The project demonstrates my ability to work with cutting-edge technologies, design and implement a complex system, and solve real-world problems.
